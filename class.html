<p >Branding and visual identity are all around us. Look closely, and you'll find them on websites,<br>
 product packaging, and different types of advertising. Even personal items, like documents and <br>
business cards, bear some form of identity. Simply put, branding is what other people thinkâ€”about<br>
 you, your company, your product, or your service.</p>
